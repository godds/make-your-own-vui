# Make Your Own VUI

With millions of Amazon Echo and Google Home devices already in households, pure Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are now squarely in the public conscience. VUIs represent one of the most significant interaction paradigm shifts since the GUI, and they are currently rather uncharted territory as far as design is concerned.

As with any infant technology, initial exploration and direction should not be left in the hands of pure technologists. Designers should try to get as hands-on with the actual experience as possible in order to understand, question and push at its possibilities and limitations. However, the barriers to getting the tech to bend to your will can often seem very high: either you need to learn how to code or you need to find a like-minded developer who can effectively act as your hands.

This workshop will get you started in creating your own Alexa skills, walking you through the concepts that currently make up nearly all VUI experiences as you go along. By the end, you will have the understanding and confidence necessary to make your own voice interactions, and start shaping possible VUI futures.
